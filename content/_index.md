Welcome to my digital corner! I'm Bharath, an enthusiastic software engineer with a primary focus on exploring the intricacies of distributed computing and delving deep into the world of low-level operating systems.

With nearly 3 years of hands-on experience, I've played a key role as a core developer at General Motors, contributing significantly to the [CarBravo](https://www.carbravo.com/) domain and spearheading projects within the [OnStar Services'](https://www.onstar.com/) streaming infrastructure. Notably, I designed routine-based batch jobs and notification services, streamlining the auditing and certification process for vehicles destined for sale. Additionally, I built and served as the component owner(SME) for an in-house message bridging service, seamlessly connecting Kafka to Azure Service Bus.

Presently engaged in the [BrightDrop](https://www.gobrightdrop.com) project, I am building real-time package tracking services and infrastructure to provide comprehensive visibility into customer products. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat or brainstorm ideas for future tech endeavors. ðŸ˜Š
